# Node-Classification

The model is used for a node prediction task on the [Cora dataset](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA) to predict the subject of a paper given its words and citations network.

Implemented 2 models here:
1. With [scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured
data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which
operate directly on graphs.[GCN] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf)
